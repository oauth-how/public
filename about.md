*OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard authorization framework for
token-based authorization on the internet.*

But how it works, how to implement it, test it, etc?

There are already resources that cover extensively the topic like
[oauth.org](https://oauth.org) / [oauth.com](https://oauth.com) with detailed
documentation and guides, the idea behind **oauth.how** is a "first steps HOW
TO"

Being a broad topic and in the spirit to try to keep things as easy as possible
([KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)) please consider
contributing to the project, at the bottom of each page you will find a "suggest
edit link ‚úç"
